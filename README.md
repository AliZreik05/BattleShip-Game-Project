A terminal-based BattleShip game that supports multiplayer (1 vs 1) or offline (against bots with multiple difficulties).
This game was part of a software construction course at AUB.
1. The BattleShipBeta.c file contains the player vs player code
2. The p.c file contains the player vs bot mode
The two mods are in separate files due to project requirements by course instructors
